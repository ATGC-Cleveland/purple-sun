Starkers HTML5
==============

Starkers HTML5 is a bare-bones WordPress theme created to act as a starting point for the theme designer.

Free of all presentational elements and non-semantic markup, Starkers HTML5 is the perfect 'blank slate' for your WordPress projects, as it's a stripped-back version of the 'Default' theme.

Best of all: it's free and fully GPL-licensed, so you can use it for whatever you like - even your commercial projects.
